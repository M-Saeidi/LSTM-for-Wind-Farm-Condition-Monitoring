# LSTM-for-Wind-Farm-Condition-Monitoring
Deep learning application for fault detection and condition monitoring in wind farms
large portion of costs of a wind farm is related to condition monitoring and O&M. Among different existing strategies for mitigation of O&M costs, the methods which use SCADA-based datasets are more popular since these systems are already installed which can be interpreted as decrease in expenses.
